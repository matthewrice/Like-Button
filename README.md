# Like Button
### https://matthewrice.github.io/Like-Button/
### Unit: Introduction to BackboneJS
### Week: 6
### Tools: HTML, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone

This app is a "like" button. Click on the button to increase the number of likes.

This assignment taught me how to...
  - use .get, .set, .on, and .toJSON on an instance of a Backbone model
  - use jQuery event listeners to change a Backbone model instance.
